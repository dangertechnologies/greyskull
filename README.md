After doing some research of my own, I came to realize that as my job is a sedentary one, and for most of my life I've been spending a big part of the day sitting down, this may have lead to my quadriceps being rather weak, and leading to bad running form.

Although running form may be decent for the first part of a long run, as my muscles get tired, they weaken and my legs begin to get angled inward, putting a lot of weight on my knees. Practicing good form is of course a virtal part of running, but I began to wonder if perhaps weakness in my thighs and hips were making that more difficult than it needs to be.

A couple of years ago I came across the weight lifting program I've enjoyed the most so far: Greyskull LP. It allowed me to see quick results, and focus on compound lifts. That said, I've also tried other popular exercise regiments like _AllPro_, but Greyskull were the one I liked the most. Everytime I've gotten started with Greyskull LP again, I've re-used my aging Excel / GDocs spreadsheet (often printed out).

When I started looking for an app to replace the spreadsheet, I found only one made specifically for GSLP, and I found it to be more lacking in both design and functionality than my spreadsheet was. I realized I could probably make an app that just re-implements my spreadsheet but with a nicer design, and add whatever features I felt couldn't be accomplished by the spreadsheet â€” so I set out to create an app just like that.

Having originally hoped it would take less than a weekend of work, I ended up in a rabbit hole of both restructuring code (from originally using Apollo with link-state-local, to using a redux style architecture with the new `React.Context` API).

Now the app is more or less finished and although it was originally intended only for me, I thought perhaps other people would like the same app, and decided to publish it on the app store: This is the first app I've actually finished and published!
